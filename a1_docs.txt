The CSS part of the assignment was not neccessarily difficult but it was the most time consuming.
Mostly because you can always improve on the style of the app.
Some of the modifications we made:
1) 'Add Movie' View: 
a) Turned smallest screen size to single column view instead of double.
b) Made changes to help-block to make it inline with the input field.
c) Poster image resizing : we are keeping the same ratio and resizing image to 450px width and 300px height, instead of stretching.
