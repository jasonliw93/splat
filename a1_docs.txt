The CSS part of the assignment was not neccessarily difficult but it was the most time consuming.
Mostly because you can always improve on the style of the app.
Some of the styling modifications we made:
1) Add Movie View: -Turned smallest screen size to single column view instead of double.
                   -Made changes to help-block to make it inline with the input field.
